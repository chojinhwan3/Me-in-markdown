# Me in Markdown

## Introduction
My name is Jacob Cho, I am a sophmore at Chatsworth Charter High School, and I have 2 siblings and a pet

My favorite book is Animal Farm or 1984 by George Orwell because it reveals how society may be suppressing certain groups, and how easily the truth can be manipulated.

A new skill that I recently learned is to solve the Rubix Cube.

Some personal achievements that I reached are that I got straight A's the last 5 years, I won multiple awards at college conferences for MUN, and that I went undefeated in my games for tennis JV.

A fun fact about myself is that I am slightly ambidextrious.

My goals for this upcoming school year is to get all 5's or 4's on my AP tests, and get straight A's.

One of the places I went during summer was Hawaii, and in Hawaii I went on multiple hikes and bought a lot of new clothes.

My favorite food that I ate during the summer is bulgogi. It is special to me because it's part of my culture, and it tastes good.

In this class I hope to learn how to better code, learn different coding languages, and get a good score on the AP test. 

My most memorable experience during the summer was going to Six Flags Magic Mountain with my friends, it was fun because the rides were fun and we were able to finally meet up in person.

I have not worked on any technology-related projects, but after this class hopefully I can make some games using code.

Some sports that I engaged in over summer was tennis. I played in a tournament and I learned how to catch a ball with the racquet.

I did not engage in any creative endeavers over summer :(

Over the summer I helped my friend with his nonprofit where we make Pokemon packs for kids in hospitals. By doing this, I got volunteer hours and also learned what I should be extra-curricular wise to have a strong college application.

I did not take part in any family traditions this summer. However, on New Year's Day, we have a tradition where we bow down to our elders and get money.

A memory that I made with my friends over the summer was hanging out and playing tennis with them.

My experiences have influenced my aspirations because certain clubs and experiences made me interested in going into a poli-sci field.
